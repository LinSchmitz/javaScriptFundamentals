# 🧩 JavaScript Challenge: Average Score Comparison

## 📌 Scenario

Two teams, **Team A** and **Team B**, play **three matches** each.
Each match gives a score, and your task is to calculate the **average score** for both teams and determine which team performed better.

This challenge is designed to practice:

- `const` vs `let`
- arithmetic operations
- boolean comparisons
- clean, readable JavaScript

---

## 📊 Given Data

**Team A scores:**

- 96
- 108
- 89

**Team B scores:**

- 88
- 91
- 110

---

## ✅ Tasks

1. Store all scores using `const`
2. Calculate the **average score** for each team
3. Create a boolean variable named `teamAWins`
   - `true` if Team A’s average score is higher
   - `false` otherwise

4. Log a **readable sentence** describing the result

---

## 🛠️ Rules & Constraints

- ❌ Do **not** use `var`
- ❌ Do **not** use `if` for simple boolean assignment
- ✅ Use arithmetic operators (`+`, `/`)
- ✅ Use comparison operators (`>`, `<`, `===`)
- ✅ Use template literals for output

---

## 🧪 Bonus (Optional)

- Round numbers **only when displaying them**
- Handle the case where both teams have the **same average score**

---

## 📤 Expected Output (Example)

```
Team A's average (97.7) is higher than Team B's (96.3)
```

or, in case of a draw:

```
Both teams have the same average score (98.0)
```

---

## 🎯 Goal

Write **clean, simple, and readable JavaScript** that clearly shows:

- correct use of variables
- proper calculations
- logical comparison using booleans

If you want, next I can:

- add a **starter code section**
- add a **solution section (hidden)**
- rewrite this as a **GitHub interview task** 😈
