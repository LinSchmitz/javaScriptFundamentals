## ** Coding Challenge #1 – Forecast Temperatures **

Given an array of forecasted maximum temperatures, the thermometer displays a string with the given temperatures.

Example: `[17, 21, 23]` will print:
```

"... 17ºC in 1 days ... 21ºC in 2 days ... 23ºC in 3 days ..."

```

---

### Your tasks:

1. Create a function `printForecast` which takes in an array `arr` and logs a string like the above to the console.
   Try it with both test datasets.

2. Use the problem-solving framework:
   - Understand the problem
   - Break it up into sub-problems

---

### Test data

- Data 1: `[17, 21, 23]`
- Data 2: `[12, 5, -5, 0, 4]`
```
