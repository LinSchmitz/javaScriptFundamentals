# 🧩 JS Practice Challenges – Beginner Level

## **5️⃣ Workout Tracker**

**Scenario:**
You track how many **push-ups** you do each day.

**Rules:**

- Goal: 50 push-ups
- If reached → "Goal achieved!"
- If below → "Keep trying!"

**Given:**

```js
const pushUps = 47;
```

**Tasks:**

1. Create a boolean variable `goalReached`
2. Log a sentence:

```
You did 47 push-ups. Keep trying!
```

💡 **Tip for all challenges:**

- Use `const` for values that don’t change
- Use `let` for values that you calculate
- Use ternary operators if you like
- Use `.toFixed()` for decimals where needed
- Keep output **readable** with template literals
